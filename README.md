-	Imagine an online shopping portal which displays the products for selling on its home page.
-	These products are coming from a third-party vendor with which the portal has tied hands to sell products.
-	The third-party vendor already has an inventory system in place which can give the list of products it is selling and their number in stock, there is no interface available to online shopping portal with which the portal can call the third-party vendor’s inventor code.
-	We want to call the third-party vendor’s code which is incompatible with client (online shopping portal) code to show the products to users on the home page.
-	Also, when online shopping portal users click on “notify me when item is back in stock” for a particular item that is out of stock currently, they get notified through email.
